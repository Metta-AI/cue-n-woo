"""Per-policy OpenSkill (Plackett-Luce) MMR ranking for a division leaderboard.

Each completed round is treated as one free-for-all match: the participating policy versions are
fed to the Bayesian rater ordered by their finishing rank (lower is better; ties allowed), so a
policy's rating reflects the strength of the opponents it actually beat, not a raw score. Rounds
are replayed oldest-first so ratings evolve causally. The displayed MMR is the conservative ordinal
mu - 3*sigma; a brand-new policy from a player who already has a rated policy starts at that
player's best established mu (with the default wide sigma) so its first ranks aren't insane.

Mirrors the platform-side ranker in app_backend `v2/commissioners.rank_division_by_mmr`.
